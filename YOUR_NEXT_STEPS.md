# Your Next Steps: MVP to Revenue-Generating System

## Immediate Testing Steps

**Priority 1: Smoke Test Core Features**
```bash
cd aicmdcenter
npm start
```

Verify these work at http://localhost:3000:
- [ ] User registration/login flow
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] All 3 AI agents respond (even with mock data)
- [ ] Database queries execute (check browser DevTools Network tab)
- [ ] Product generation workflow completes end-to-end

**Priority 2: Database Connection Test**
```bash
# Check if Supabase connection is active
npm run db:test
```
If this fails, verify `aicmdcenter/.env` contains valid `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
